<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>I created a pipeline to scrape all the most recent and comprehensive car data I could find.
  Features include: horsepower, cylinders, displacement, country of origin and more.</p>
<h2>The Model</h2>
<p>I trained a random forest regressor to predict mpg from the remaining features.
